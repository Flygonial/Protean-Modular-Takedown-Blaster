A spiritual successor to the Gryphon, though not a replacement. Leaning further to the direction of modularity, Protean is a highly-configurable, conventional-layout mag-fed flywheel blaster. 7 takedown pins are all that stands between you and being capable of swapping flywheel cages, magwells, stocks, and pusher mechanisms with no additional tools. Not only does this make adjusting the blaster for different game velocity caps trivial, it also makes it possible to swap configurations even between rounds of an event, and in some cases replace broken parts. 

Currently supported configurations include:

* Single-stage flywheel cages between 39.5 and 43.5mm
* Dual-stage flywheel cages between 39.5 and 43.5mm
* Talon magwell
* 14.5mm or 14.0mm bore insert
* Straight PCAR or BCAR (angles from 12.5 down to 4 degrees available) bore insert
* 4-to-1 geared pusher mechanism
* Thumbscrew-secured and notch-locking rod stocks
* Fixed battery stock in short and extended lengths.
* Buffer tube battery stock (refer to the Gryphon for stock files)

Configurations in the open beta include:

* Solenoid pusher mechanism (Out of Darts Neutron)
* Flatbar Battery Stock with squeeze-to-collapse mech
* Bolt-secured flywheel cages (require additional M3 Nut, M3x35 bolt, 2 M3 heatset inserts, and additional M3x10 bolts).

Future features planned include:

* Full-length receiver
* Hurricane and microwheel geometry support
* Microcontroller-driven select-fire and single-trigger control with plug & play code
